While reading up on renewable energy, every now and then an article mentioning hydrogen as an alternative would pop up. 

Hydrogen, in the grand family of renewable energy sources, is sort of the middle child. It's been getting steady attention lately, as the younger sibling of the flashy, popular solar and the robust, reliable wind. You know the type: solar is the influencer, always in the spotlight with its shiny panels basking in the sun, while wind is the sturdy, dependable one, tirelessly turning those massive blades. Then there's hydrogen – not as immediately charming as solar, nor as straightforward as wind, but with a quiet potential that's hard to ignore. Hydrogen is the utility player, a versatile player good at a bunch of things.

The Current Problem



The way we produce it currently is a problem.

The role of hydrogen in a grid dominated by renewables

If renewables are cheaper than nuclear energy and the trends look like this disparity will only increase, can we just focus fully on renewables? Not necessarily, because renewable energy supply is volatile in a number of different ways. There are predictable daily fluctuations in production (lots of sun at noon, little sun in the evening), predictable seasonal fluctuations (less sun in the winter) and unpredictable semi-regular fluctuations (multi-day events of low wind).

While you can hedge against the predictable fluctuations somewhat through optimizing the ratio of wind to solar resources (the production peaks/troughs of wind and solar cancel out somewhat), seasonal fluctuations and unpredictable events remain thorny problems. This leaves us with two needs for our grids. Flexible short-term generation capacity to offset daily fluctuations and long-term stable production to offset longer time periods of supply-demand mismatch.

Nuclear power is pretty unequipped to handle the first kind of need since most reactors take a long time to ramp production up and down and because the high price tag of nuclear power means that running the reactor at anything less than its maximum production would be economically infeasible. The second need is something that nuclear power could potentially fulfill. Here the question is simply which of the available technologies (battery storage, Pump storage hydro, geo-thermal) ends up being the cheapest and most scalable.

(Disclaimer for this section: modeling electricity grids is very complicated because it combines a bunch of different sources of uncertainty. It’s also highly location-based and subject to lots of crucial assumptions about market behavior, cost curves and weather patterns. Therefore, these considerations can lead to different conclusions for different regions.)
