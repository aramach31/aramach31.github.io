## Background

The 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to the scientists behind the development of Lithium-ion batteries, first introduced to the market in 1991. Since then, within the next 30 years, they've only gotten better, with volumetric density increasing threefold and the costs dropping tenfold.

This chart is slightly outdated, but gives us something to be proud of. In less than 30 years, the Li-ion battery has found its way to almost every technological equipment we've interacted with.

The story for the last couple of years has been a little more muted, primarily due to supply chain chocks resulting from the pandemic, rising demand as the global economy started to recover and the Russia-Ukraine war, among other factors.

The chart above suggests that battery prices have plateaued. But there are telling signs that could make us expect further drops in prices, with average battery pack prices falling to $139 per kilowatt hour as of November 2023, a 14% drop from $161/kWh in 2022<sup>[1](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-26/battery-prices-are-falling-again-as-raw-material-costs-drop)</sup>. From IEA,

>The combination of an expected 40% increase in supply and slower growth in demand, especially for EVs in China, has contributed to this trend. This drop – if sustained – could translate into lower battery prices.

So with this mind, where do we go from here? With Sodium ion and solid state batteries on the horizon, can we make a guess as to how that'll go?

### Cathode

The cathode represents over 50% of the total cost in producing battery cells, with key components like Lithium, Nickel, and Cobalt accounting for approximately 50-65% of the cost, fluctuating with raw material prices. These metals are not only expensive but also come with several other challenges. For instance, consider Cobalt. Battery manufacturers are actively seeking alternatives to cobalt due to several reasons:

1. Cost: Cobalt is the second most expensive mineral used in batteries. While Lithium carbonate currently holds the top spot, its price is expected to decrease as supply begins to meet the demand deficit.

2. Supply and Geopolitical Risk: More than 60% of the world's cobalt supply originates from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a region plagued by political instability and ethical concerns in mining practices<sup>[2](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2023/02/01/1152893248/red-cobalt-congo-drc-mining-siddharth-kara).

3. Scarcity: Forecasts indicate significant regional disparities in cobalt demand and supply, as well as supply security levels. This imbalance is expected to lead to a shortage between 2028 and 2033<sup>[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29022-z).
