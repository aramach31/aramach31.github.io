## Background

The logistics industry is ruthless. From a Strategy&/PwC report<sup>[1](https://www.pwc.com/sg/en/publications/assets/future-of-the-logistics-industry.pdf)</sup>:

>In contrast with other industries, profits in logistics are relatively low. Yet, within this sector, EBIT margins generally range from -1% to 8%. While carriers find themselves close to zero profit, sometimes even in the red, the large CEP companies end up being the most profitable group, sometimes reaching double-digit profit margins.

This article is focused on understanding the Indian market. What's interesting about India is that the industry is heavily fragmented, with the top 10 organized players commanding ~1.5% of the market. Look elsewhere, and you'll see double digit percentages.
